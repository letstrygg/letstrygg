  <h3>🌝 Explore, Equip, Survive</h3>
  <p><em>He is Coming</em> is a minimalist RPG auto battler where you explore for gear, build synergies, and try to make the numbers go up — all before time runs out and the next boss arrives.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One boss appears every 3 days — adapt or die</li>
    <li>Over 350 items with endless combinations</li>
    <li>Make tradeoffs between gear, risk, and timing</li>
    <li>Inventory management is half the battle</li>
    <li>The world decays with each cycle — no run is the same</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🏆 Kingmaker Multiplayer</h3>
