<p><strong>Hell Builder</strong> is a roguelike city builder where every structure placement shapes the path to victory. Strategically lay down hellish buildings from a deck of cards to earn Souls, unlock new structures, and eventually fulfill the Dark Lord’s infernal vision.</p>

<p>Master synergy chains to optimize your domain. When your resources run dry, Transmute your hellscape into powerful relics and start fresh—with progress that lasts. It’s a quick-session strategy loop with puzzle-like placement and permanent upgrades.</p>
